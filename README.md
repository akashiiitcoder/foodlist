#foodlist
This a simple food nutrition management platform with a user page and an admin page.
The admin can create, update, delete any food macronutient data, i.e., protein, fat and carb, which would be further stored by redux store.
The calories would be counted automatically based on the information provided by the user.
All the data is represented in a nice table format to both admin and user, to increase the user experience.
The website is hosted using gh-pages, and is live at https://akashiiitcoder.github.io/foodlist/
